- Trees are hierarchical DS that contains node connected by edges.
- why trees
	- stacks, queues, arrays, linkedlist are linear
		- time complexity increases with increase in the size of the data set.
	
- Terminologies
	- Node
		- contains a key/value.
		- contains a pointer to other(child) nodes.
		- internal node = atleast one children.
	- Edge
	- height 
		- node
			- no. of edges from node to deepest leaf
		- tree
			- no. of edges from the lead node to the deepest leaf.
	- depth of a node
		- no. of edges from root node to the node
	- degree of a node
		- total no. of branches of that node
	- Forest
		no of disjoint trees 

- features
	- moderate access/search time(>array, <linked list);
	- not size bound
	- moderate insertion deletion (quicker than array, slower than unordered linked list)
- application
	- heiarchical data
	- search
	- manipulate sorted list
- Binary Tree
	- Full binary tree
		- every node has '0 or 2' child node
	- complete binary tree
		- all levels are filled except for the last level in which the elements are as left as possible
	- perfect
		- all leaf node are at the same level
	- degenerate 
		- every internal node has 1 child
- Deletion
	- get the right most node and interchange it with the node to be deleted
	- then delete the right most node;
- Traversal
	- every travesal is O(n) time complexity
	- BFS starts from the root
	- DFS starts from the leaves
	- linear : one way to read data.
	- trees
		- Depth First Search Traversal
			- inorder
				- uses 
					- in BST it gives the nodes in non decreasing order
				- logic
					- recursive
						- inorder(root->left)
						- display(root->data)
						- inorder(root->right)
					- iterative
						- w stack
							{
								Stack<TreeNode> stack = new Stack<>();
								TreeNode current = root;
								while(current != null || !stack.empty()){
									while(current!=null){
										stack.push(current);
										current = current.left;
									}
									current = stack.pop();
									sout(current.value);
									current = current.right;
								}
							}
						- w/o stack - Morris traversal
							
				- uses 
					- print the tree in increasing order
				
			- preorder
				- uses
					- used to create a create a copy of a tree
					- used to get the prefix expression of expression tree
				- logic
					- recursive
						- display(root->data)
						- preorder(root->left)
						- preorder(root->right)
					- iterative
						- w stack
							{
								stack s = new Stack();
								c = root;
								
								while(c!=null || !s.empty()){
									while(c!=null){
										sout(c.value);
										s.push(c)
										c = c.left;
									}
									c = s.pop();
									s = c.right();
								}
							}
			- postorder
				- uses	
					- used to delete the tree
				- logic
					- recursive
						- postorder(root->left)
						- postorder(root->right)
						- display(root->data)
					- iterative
						- w 2 stack
							{
								Stack<> s = new Stack<>(), o = new Stack<>();
								s.push(root);
								while(!s.empty()){
									TreeNode t = s.pop();
									o.push(t);
									if(t.left!=null) s.push(t.left);
									if(t.right!=null) s.push(t.right);
								}
								
								while(!o.empty()){
									sout(o.pop());
								}
							}

Trie : Prefix tree
	- retrieval of key in the data set of the string
	- application	
		- autocomplete
		- t9 predictive text
		- ip routing 
		- spell checker
	- trie is a rooted tree
		- NODE STRUCTURE 	
			- has R links 
			- has boolean flag is end
