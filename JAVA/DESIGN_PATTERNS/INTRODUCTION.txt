- Design Principles
	-  Types
		- Single Responsibility Principle
			- there must be only one reason to change a class
		
		- Open closed Principles
			- Open for extension
			- Closed for modification
			- Decorator pattern help us achieve (Factory Method/ Observer Pattern may help)
			- adds extra layer of abstraction
		- Liskov Substitution Problem
		
			- Derived class must be completely substitutable with Base types
		
		- Interface Segregation Principle
			- client should not depend on interface they dont use
			- increases the flexibility
		
		- Dependency Inversion Principles
			- Abstraction should not depend on details, details should depend on abstraction
			- High level modules should not depend on low level modules 
			- High level module --> Abstraction Layer --> Low level module
			- Template pattern
			
- Design Patterns Types
	- Creational
		- used when creating an object
			ref = new Object()
		- types
			- Factory
				- use the interface or abstract class for defining the object and let the subclass decide which to instantiate
				- constructs single objects
				- aka virtual Constructor
			- Abstract Factory
				- provides an interface for creation of related or dependent objects without concrete class
				- constructs multiple object
				- also known as a KIT	
					
			- Singleton
				- common entry point
				- heavy object
				- when we want only one instance
				- when 
					- serializable singleton then must have readResolve
			- Object Pool
			- Prototype
			- Builder
				- helps you create complex objects step by step
