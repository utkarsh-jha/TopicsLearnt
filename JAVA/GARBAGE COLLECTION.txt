- Four types are eligible for garbage collection
	- nullifying the reference
	- re-assigning a ref variable
	- method local objects
	- island of isolation (objects not referenced by any active)

- we don not know when JVM runs a garbage collector
- explicit GC call
	- System.gc();
	- Runtime.getRuntime().gc()
