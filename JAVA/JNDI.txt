Naming and Directory concepts
	- naming concepts
		- association of objects with the name 
			- like DNS associaties domain name to IP
	- Syntax one must follow when naming is called naming conventions
	- association is called binding 
	- context is a set of name to object binding
		- has a lookup optionation for resolving object from references
	- directory - same as naming service but with attribute
	
	- user -> JNDI API -> JNDI SPI service provider interface
JNDI
	- java naming and directory interface
	- independent of any specific directory service implementation
	- Java provides
		- LDAP, CORBA COS, RMI, DNS
	- packages
		- javax.naming
			- Context(i)
				- lookup
				- listBindings
				- 
			- InitialContext
			- NamingException
		- javax.naming.directory
		- javax.naming.ldap
		- javax.naming.event
		- javax.naming.spi
	- Applications 
		- multiple environments, eg data source, configure it in jboss is the best solution
- LDAP	
	- phone book type
	- write once read many times
	- fast reads over large data sets
	- slower add/delete/update	
	- LDAP is a type of optimization layer over DB 
	- and the data to be accessed is small
	
- Context 
	- allows to perform operations on naming service 
	- must have for JNDI
