	- Phases
	
- Cyclic Barriers 
	- when we have fixed number of thread wait for each other before continuing execution
	- called cyclic because it can be reused after all the waiting threads are released 
	- calling await() makes the thread to reach the barrier point.
	- when all the parties have called the await() method is called tripping the barrier.
	
	- constructor new CyclicBarrier(int parties) 
		- parties is the number of thread that must call the await().
	- CyclicBarrier(int parties, Runnable barrierAction)
