What is it:
it answers, does an element belongs to a particular set.

Prerequisites:
	- size of the bloom filter? say m = 5;
	
	- Then we define few hash functions
		say	h1(x) = x mod 5  
			h2(x) = (2x + 3) mod 5
		
	- When we insert an element (e)
	- then calculte h1(e), h2(e) 
	
	- We take a bloom filter array of size t A[t], 
		say A[5]
	
	- depending upon the h1(e) = l and h2(e) = 
	
	
Flase positive (Yes)
	- if answer is positive, then it might be present (not sure)
	- Bloom is false positive
	
False negative (No)
	- Bloom filter is not false negative
		- if answer is not present then it surely not present.
