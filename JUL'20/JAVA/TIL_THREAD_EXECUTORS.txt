* Sychronization
	- if a threads calls a method or a block which is synchronized it acquires an intrinsic lock (monitor)
	- other threads are blocked until the thread is released
	
	Disadvantages
		- Deadlocks causing
		- Starvation : some thread can not get the resource when competing 
		- less throughput
		

Package : java.util.concurrent
1. Units of execution	
	- Process
		- private memory space (not shared)
		- an application is a single process
		- jvm creates a single process but we can create different process using process builder (Multiprocess Application (1))
	- Threads
		- takes less resources as creating a new process
			- say shared memory spaces and open files
			- Every process has atleast one thread
			- single thread is main thread that has ability to create more threads.
2. Thread object (https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/lang/Thread.html)
	- Since JDK 1.0
	- in java each thread is associated with an object of the Thread class.
	- ways 
		- direct control live cycle, instantiating the thread each time async is needed.
		- abstract the thread management through executor.
	- java.lang.Thread extends java.lang.Object implements runnable.
 	- execution continues till
		- runtime exit (2) call.
		- all the non deamon thread has returned after execution.
	- creation
		- extends thread class and overrides the run method
		- implementing runnable and implements the run method
			- then pass the runnable obj instance to a thread constructor as a parameter and summon the start()

3. Define and start
	- Runnable interface
		- @Functional interfaces as only run method is there.
		- JDK 1.0
		- more flexible
	- Thread class
		- for simple and light weight application as it is more simple
		- it has several methods including the static ones
4. Pausing a thread
	- Thread.sleep
	- gives another thread a chance
	- static void sleep (calls the native method) and static native void sleep (can throw illegal argument exception)
	- causes InterruptedException when another thread interrupts when the thread is sleep;
5. Interrupts
	- A thread call the interrupt on the Thread object to be interrupted.
		- throws Security exception when the thread cannot be interrupted..
		- interrupted resets the thread status
		- isInterrupted used by another thread to get the status of the thread. does not resets the thread.
	- means to stop whatever it is doing and do something else
	- methods that throws this exception do so to immediately return when the interupt is received;
	- Thread.interrupted() checks whether the thread is interrupted.
6. join
	- causes the current thread to wait untill the mentioned thread is completed execution
		- t.join -> called thread will wait for thread T to complete
	- can be interrupted like join
	- overloaded join() can be used to specify the time 

7. Synchronization

It is a framework that helps us with 
1. Thread Creation	
	helps in creating threads and pools
2. Thread Management
	you dont have to worried about the thread in a pool for submitting a task execution
3. Task execution
	excetion can be instant, delayed or periodic

Java Concurrency API.

Three major executor interfaces:
	- Executor	
		execute() method that launch the task specified by the runnable object. 
	- Executor Service 
		- extends Executor
		- adds functionality to manage the life cycle.
		- contains a submit() method, that takes runnable and callable (overloaded method).
		
	- Scheduled Executor Service
		- extends ExecutorService
		- functionality to execute a scheduled activity.
